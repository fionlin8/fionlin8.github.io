## Backstory
Daddy? Who? Probably not the one you are thinking about (hush with the giggles), but Daddy, as in my God. I know that not everybody is religious, but creating my personal website, following God is a big part of my life and can’t be missed. This past weekend, I went on a retreat with my church Harvest. Going in, I was carrying a lot of burden on my heart from all the rejections from clubs, school, and even how I felt towards my friendships. I was running down a dark tunnel that stretched for miles. Everyday I would wonder when I would ever see the light, would things get any better than this? I battle with a lot of pride and I hated how I felt like a failure. This was not how Fion Lin was suppose to be in sophomore year. All these rejections discouraged me from seeing the blessings God has given me,  I often asked myself, how come God is closing all these doors on me? Doesn’t He love me? 

## Theme
In this year’s Harvest retreat, the main topic was: Daddy loves you. What does it mean to be loved by God? It means that all our efforts to please Him are meaningless. Whether it is going to church every Sunday for the sake of keeping a reputation or going to a party or not, these efforts mean nothing. The one thing that matters is our heart and how we love and chase God with everything we have. 

> Morever, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in > their toil – this is a gift of God. Then seldom reflect on the days of their life, because God keepes them occupied with > gladness of heart. – Ecclesiastes 5:19
  
### Takeaway
Hearing Pastor Paul’s stories and metaphors, I was touched by how I related to the little boy who would continually seek the mailman’s love even though his father was showering love upon him. I was seeking love from the acceptance of others and finding value in achievements. The stress and anxiety I felt from putting all my cards out there meant nothing. The future for me could not be entirely be molded by my hands. Everything that I was working on was driven by my own greed and I had no room for my God. Coming back to campus, I hope to continue surrendering to my Daddy up in heaven and know that He loves me unconditionally, despite my mistakes and countless efforts.
