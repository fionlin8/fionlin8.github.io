## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I'm currently a sophomore studying business at the Ross School of Business here at the University of Michigan! I'm from Brooklyn, NY and coming to college out of state was thrilling. I wanted to find what I liked about business and currently my interests are in tech. Business in tech is the perfect medly for me because I liked serving people and also I loved how tech represented the future. To describe my work ethic and outlook on life, my friend gifted me a necklace curated from personality traits and mine was dreamer. 

I am a dreamer, a native New Yorker, and my favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate.

### Projects
<div class="box">
  <p>
During the summer of 2019, I was a Brand Strategy Intern for Mott Optical Group. My overall goal was to bring the generational business into the modern world where businesses are going digital and e-commerce is quite common. I used Shopify to upload their designer eyewear and created content on their brands, events, and promotions. I enjoyed using my HTML & CSS skills to design their page into one that was easy to navigate through. I also learned a lot about the eyewear industry and how it is a mix between healthcare, fashion, and business. Business is in every aspect of our lives and I saw how my work directly affected the families in the surrounding Chinatown neighborhood.
