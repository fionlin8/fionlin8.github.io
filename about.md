## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I'm currently a sophomore studying business at the Ross School of Business here at the University of Michigan! I'm from Brooklyn, NY and coming to college out of state was thrilling. I wanted to find what I liked about business and currently my interests are in tech. Business in tech is the perfect medly for me because I liked serving people and also I loved how tech represented the future. To describe my work ethic and outlook on life, my friend gifted me a necklace curated from personality traits and mine was dreamer. 

I am a dreamer, a native New Yorker, and my favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate.
